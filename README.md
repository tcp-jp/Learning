1. Read up on Von Neumann architechture // Von Neumann Vs Harvard 
2. Understand fully the stack and other elements of the CPU (i.e. heap)
3. Learn basics of Assembly
  1. Create variables
  2. Print text to screen
  3. Perform mathmatical operations
  4. Create iterative and conditional loops
  5. Create functions
  6. Registers 
4. Create 5 Assembly projects in increasing difficulty
