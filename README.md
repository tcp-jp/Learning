Learning Path 
-------------
### Overview 
##### Currently Learning : Assembly 
##### Prep 
* Von Neumann 
* Von Neumann Vs Harvard
* Registers
##### Next Steps 
To Complete This (Update as needed)
1. Read up on Von Neumann architechture // Von Neumann Vs Harvard 
2. Understand fully the stack and other elements of the CPU (i.e. heap)
3. Learn basics of Assembly
   1. Create variables
   2. Print text to screen
   3. Perform mathmatical operations
   4. Create iterative and conditional loops
   5. Create functions
   6. Registers 
4. Create fundamental commands that are versatile to use - i.e. a for loop that can be crafted with pseudocode similar to python
##### After This 
* Move onto C
