Learning Path 
-------------
### Overview 
##### Currently Learning : Assembly 
###### Next Steps 
To Complete This (Update as needed)
1. Read up on Von Neumann architechture // Von Neumann Vs Harvard 
2. Understand fully the stack and other elements of the CPU (i.e. heap)
3. Learn basics of Assembly
   1. Create variables
   2. Print text to screen
   3. Perform mathmatical operations
   4. Create iterative and conditional loops
   5. Create functions
   6. Registers 
4. Create 5 Assembly projects in increasing difficulty
   1. Calculator that performs operations depending on operator provided
   2. Network connection logger
   3. File Cleaner
   4. Text Editor
   5. Game
